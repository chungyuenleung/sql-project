**Description :** Welcome onboard, I am excited to introduce my latest python project, which involves the analysis of a dataset called AdventureWorks2019. The main objective of this project was to address several important questions related to the dataset, such as the regional sales in the best performing country, the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus, the relationship between country and revenue, the relationship between sick leave and job title, the relationship between store trading duration and revenue, and the relationship between the size of stores, the number of employees, and revenue.<br>
The AdventureWorks2019 dataset is a comprehensive collection of sales and employee data from a fictional company. Through a rigorous analysis of this dataset, I was able to identify key patterns and relationships that can help inform business decisions and improve overall performance. <br>
Database: AdventureWorks2019 <br>
Tools: SSMS(T-SQL), Thonny <br>
Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib <br>
